# Buffered-mult
A simple, compact 2 x 1:3 / 1 x 1:6 buffered multiple for eurorack utilising high quality OPA4171/OPA2171 opamps for suave sound performance and 1206 components to make it easy for anyone to solder.

This circuit is inspired by [Mutable Instruments LINKS.](http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/links)

###It works like this:


#####1:6 mult
Plug a cable into the IN1 jack to get a signal distributed in a 1:7 mult.

#####2 x 1:3 mult
Plug one cable into IN1 and another into IN2/OUT4 and boom, the signal at each of the two inputs is then distributed in 1:3 mults.
